# research_articles
This repository is part of my personal academic website and it archives the articles in which I appear as co-author in their distributable form (e.g. Author Accepted Manuscript version).

My research interests and endeavours lie in the intersection between the internationalization process of the firm, the behavioural theory of the firm, and the behaviour and boundedly rational decision making inside organisations. Below you can find links to my ORCID iD, National Research Council (CONCyTEC, Peru), Researchgate, and LinkedIn profiles.
